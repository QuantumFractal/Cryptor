Cryptor
=======

NOTE: This app is currently being submitted to Dropbox for public usage approval!

A layer of security for your Dropbox files! 
Cryptor uses Gnu Privacy Guard (GPG) keys stored locally on your computer to encrypt and upload your files securely to your Dropbox. So even if Dropbox is broken into, your files are safe under YOUR lock and key. The vision of this project is to make file encryption seamless, so that everyone can use Cryptor to keep their files safe.

The application is currently in the form of an API, I'm currently writing an application wrapper (See: Road map)
Documentation is currently being written, check back for more!


### How To:
Below are the steps to get Cryptor setup on your computer (so far anyways)

1. Download / Fork this repo.
2. Make a folder for Cryptor to work out of.
3. Run 'config.py'
4. Specify the folder you want Cryptor to use.
5. Authenticate Cryptor with your account.
6. Play around with the API to push and pull your files securely!
