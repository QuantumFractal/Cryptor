Cryptor
=======

A layer of security for your Dropbox files! 
Cryptor uses Gnu Privacy Guard (GPG) keys stored locally on your computer to encrypt and upload your files securily to your Dropbox. So even if Dropbox is broken into, your files are safe under YOUR lock and key. The vision of this project is to make file encryption seemless, so that everyone can use Cryptor to keep their files safe. 

Documentation is currently being written, check back for more!
